# Winter maybe-async

This crate contains the `maybe_async` procedural attribute macro and the `maybe_await` procedural macro which abstract away Rust sync/async.

## maybe_async

The `maybe_async` macro will conditionally add the `async` keyword to a function it marks depending on the `async` feature being enabled. To generate the asynchronous version, enable the `async` feature on the crate. If the `async` feature is off, the synchronous version will be generated. For example,

```rust
// Adding `maybe_async` to trait functions
trait ExampleTrait {
    #[maybe_async]
    fn say_hello(&self);

    #[maybe_async]
    fn get_hello(&self) -> String;
}

// Adding `maybe_async` to regular functions
#[maybe_async]
fn hello_world() {
    // ...
}
```

## maybe_await

To compliment `maybe_async` we also have the `maybe_await` procedural macro that conditionally adds the `.await` keyword to the end of an expression depending on the `async` feature flag.

```rust
#[maybe_async]
fn hello_world() {
    // Adding `maybe_await` to an expression
    let w = maybe_await!(world());

    println!("hello {}", w);
}

#[maybe_async]
fn world() -> String {
    "world".to_string()
}
```
