// This module contains helper functions as well as constants used to perform a 8x8 vector-matrix
// multiplication. The special form of our MDS matrix i.e. being circulant, allows us to reduce
// the vector-matrix multiplication to a Hadamard product of two vectors in "frequency domain".
// This follows from the simple fact that every circulant matrix has the columns of the discrete
// Fourier transform matrix as orthogonal eigenvectors.
// The implementation also avoids the use of internal 2-point FFTs, and 2-point iFFTs, and substitutes
// them with explicit expressions. It also avoids, due to the form of our matrix in the frequency domain,
// divisions by 2 and repeated modular reductions. This is because of our explicit choice of
// an MDS matrix that has small powers of 2 entries in frequency domain.
// The following implementation has benefited greatly from the discussions and insights of
// Hamish Ivey-Law and Jacqueline Nabaglo of Polygon Zero is based on Nabaglo's implementation
// in [Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2).
// The circulant matrix is identified by its first row: [23, 8, 13, 10, 7, 6, 21, 8].

// MDS matrix in frequency domain.
// More precisely, this is the output of the two 4-point (real) FFTs of the first column of
// the MDS matrix i.e. just before the multiplication with the appropriate twiddle factors
// and application of the final four 2-point FFT in order to get the full 8-point FFT.
// The entries have been scaled appropriately in order to avoid divisions by 2 in iFFT2 and iFFT4.
