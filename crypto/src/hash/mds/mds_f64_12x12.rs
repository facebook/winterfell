/// This module contains helper functions as well as constants used to perform a 12x12 vector-matrix
/// multiplication. The special form of our MDS matrix i.e. being circulant, allows us to reduce
/// the vector-matrix multiplication to a Hadamard product of two vectors in "frequency domain".
/// This follows from the simple fact that every circulant matrix has the columns of the discrete
/// Fourier transform matrix as orthogonal eigenvectors.
/// The implementation also avoids the use of 3-point FFTs, and 3-point iFFTs, and substitutes that
/// with explicit expressions. It also avoids, due to the form of our matrix in the frequency domain,
/// divisions by 2 and repeated modular reductions. This is because of our explicit choice of
/// an MDS matrix that has small powers of 2 entries in frequency domain.
/// The following implementation has benefited greatly from the discussions and insights of
/// Hamish Ivey-Law and Jacqueline Nabaglo of Polygon Zero and is based on Nabaglo's implementation
/// in [Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2).
/// The circulant matrix is identified by its first row: [7, 23, 8, 26, 13, 10, 9, 7, 6, 22, 21, 8].

// MDS matrix in frequency domain.
// More precisely, this is the output of the three 4-point (real) FFTs of the first column of
// the MDS matrix i.e. just before the multiplication with the appropriate twiddle factors
// and application of the final four 3-point FFT in order to get the full 12-point FFT.
// The entries have been scaled appropriately in order to avoid divisions by 2 in iFFT2 and iFFT4.
// The code to generate the matrix in frequency domain is based on an adaptation of a code, to generate
// MDS matrices efficiently in original domain, that was developed by the Polygon Zero team.
