/// This is a cryptographic primitive allowing one to commit, using a commitment string `com`, to
/// a vector of values (v_0, ..., v_{n-1}) such that one can later reveal the value at the i-th
/// position.
///
/// This is achieved by providing the value `v_i` together with a proof `proof_i` such that anyone
/// posessing `com` can be convinced, with high confidence, that the claim is true.
///
/// Vector commitment schemes usually have some batching properties in the sense that opening
/// proofs for a number of `(i, v_i)` can be batched together into one batch opening proof in order
/// to optimize both the proof size as well as the verification time.
///
/// The current implementation restricts both of the commitment string as well as the leaf values
/// to be `H::Digest` where `H` is a type parameter such that `H: Hasher`.
