// RAP TRACE TABLE
// ================================================================================================
/// A concrete implementation of the [Trace] trait supporting custom RAPs.
///
/// This implementation should be sufficient for most use cases.
/// To create a trace table, you can use [RapTraceTable::new()] function, which takes trace
/// width and length as parameters. This function will allocate memory for the trace, but will not
/// fill it with data. To fill the execution trace, you can use the [fill()](RapTraceTable::fill)
/// method, which takes two closures as parameters:
///
/// 1. The first closure is responsible for initializing the first state of the computation (the
///    first row of the execution trace).
/// 2. The second closure receives the previous state of the execution trace as input, and must
///    update it to the next state of the computation.
///
/// You can also use [RapTraceTable::with_meta()] function to create a blank execution trace.
/// This function work just like [RapTraceTable::new()] function, but also takes a metadata
/// parameter which can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes up to 64KB in size.
