// VERIFIER CHANNEL TRAIT
// ================================================================================================

/// Defines an interface for a channel over which a verifier communicates with a prover.
///
/// This trait abstracts away implementation specifics of the [FriProof] struct. Thus, instead of
/// dealing with FRI proofs directly, the verifier can read the data as if it was sent by the
/// prover via an interactive channel.
///
/// Note: that reading removes the data from the channel. Thus, reading duplicated values from
/// the channel should not be possible.

    /// verifier one-by-one, and the verifier responds with a value α drawn uniformly at random
    /// from the entire field after each layer commitment is received. In the non-interactive
