// PROVER CHANNEL TRAIT
// ================================================================================================

/// Defines an interface for a channel over which a prover communicates with a verifier.
///
/// The prover uses this channel to send commitments to FRI layer polynomials to the verifier, and
/// then to draw a random value α from the channel after each commitment is sent. The prover then
/// uses this α to construct the next FRI layer.
///
/// In the interactive version of the protocol, the verifier chooses α uniformly at random from
/// the entire field. In the non-interactive version, the α is drawn pseudo-randomly based on the
/// commitments the prover has written into the channel up to this point.

    /// Hash function used by the prover to commit to polynomial evaluations.
    type Hasher: ElementHasher<BaseField = E::BaseField>;

    /// Sends a layer commitment to the verifier.
    ///
    /// A layer commitment is the commitment string of a vector commitment to the vector of
    /// evaluations of a polynomial at a given layer. The vector commitment is built by
    /// first transposing evaluations into a two-dimensional matrix where each row contains
    /// values needed to compute a single value of the next FRI layer, and then computing
    /// the hash of each row to get one entry of the vector being committed to. Thus, the number
    /// of elements grouped into a single leaf is equal to the `folding_factor` used for FRI layer
    /// construction.

    ///
    /// The prover uses this α to build the next FRI layer.
