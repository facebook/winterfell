// PROVER CHANNEL TRAIT
// ================================================================================================

/// Defines an interface for a channel over which a prover communicates with a verifier.
///
/// The prover uses this channel to send commitments to FRI layer polynomials to the verifier, and
/// then to draw a random value α from the channel after each commitment is sent. The prover then
/// uses this α to construct the next FRI layer.
///
/// In the interactive version of the protocol, the verifier chooses α uniformly at random from
/// the entire field. In the non-interactive version, the α is drawn pseudo-randomly based on the
/// commitments the prover has written into the channel up to this point.
pub trait ProverChannel<E: FieldElement> {
    /// Hash function used by the prover to commit to polynomial evaluations.
    type Hasher: Hasher;

    /// Sends a layer commitment to the verifier.
    ///
    /// A layer commitment is a root of a Merkle tree built from evaluations of a polynomial
    /// at a given layer. The Merkle tree is built by first transposing evaluations into a
    /// two-dimensional matrix where each row contains values needed to compute a single
    /// value of the next FRI layer, and then putting each row of the matrix into a single
    /// leaf of the Merkle tree. Thus, the number of elements grouped into a single leaf is
    /// equal to the `folding_factor` used for FRI layer construction.

    ///
    /// The prover uses this α to build the next FRI layer.
    ///
