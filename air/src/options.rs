/// fields, security offered by the base field itself may be inadequate or insufficient, and an
/// extension of the base field may need to be used.
///
/// For example, if the size of base field is ~64-bits, a quadratic extension must be use to
/// achieve ~100 bits of soundness, and a cubic extension must be used to achieve 128+ bits
/// of soundness.
///
/// However, increasing extension degree will increase proof generation time and proof size by
/// as much as 50%.

/// STARK protocol parameters.
///
/// These parameters have a direct impact on proof soundness, proof generation time, and proof
/// size. Specifically:
///
/// 1. Finite field - proof soundness depends on the size of finite field used by the protocol.
///    This means, that for small fields (e.g. smaller than ~128 bits), field extensions must be
///    used to achieve adequate security. And even for ~128 bit fields, to achieve security over
///    100 bits, a field extension may be required.
/// 2. Number of queries - higher values increase proof soundness, but also increase proof size.
/// 3. Blowup factor - higher values increase proof soundness, but also increase proof generation
///    time and proof size. However, higher blowup factors require fewer queries for the same
///    security level. Thus, it is frequently possible to increase blowup factor and at the same
///    time decrease the number of queries in such a way that the proofs become smaller.
/// 4. Grinding factor - higher values increase proof soundness, but also may increase proof
///    generation time. More precisely, conjectured proof soundness is bounded by
///    `num_queries * log2(blowup_factor) + grinding_factor`.
/// 5. Batching method - either independent random values per multi-point quotient are used in
///    the computation of the DEEP polynomial or powers of a single random value are used
///    instead. The first type of batching is called `Linear` while the second is called `Algebraic`.
///
/// Another important parameter in defining STARK security level, which is not a part of [ProofOptions]
/// is the hash function used in the protocol. The soundness of a STARK proof is limited by the
/// collision resistance of the hash function used by the protocol. For example, if a hash function
/// with 128-bit collision resistance is used, soundness of a STARK proof cannot exceed 128 bits.
///
/// In addition, partition options (see [PartitionOptions]) can be provided to split traces during
/// proving and distribute work across multiple devices. Taking the main segment trace as an example,
/// the prover will split the main segment trace into `num_partitions` parts, and then proceed to hash
/// each part row-wise resulting in `num_partitions` digests per row of the trace. Finally,
/// `num_partitions` digests (per row) are combined into one digest (per row) and at this point
/// a vector commitment scheme can be called. In the case when `num_partitions` is equal to `1` (default)
/// the prover will hash each row in one go producing one digest per row of the trace.
