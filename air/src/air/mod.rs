// AIR TRAIT
// ================================================================================================
/// Describes algebraic intermediate representation of a computation.
///
/// To describe AIR for a given computation, you'll need to implement the `Air` trait which
/// involves the following:
///
/// 1. Define base field for your computation via the [Air::BaseElement] associated type (see
///    [math::fields] for available field options).
/// 2. Define a set of public inputs which are required for your computation via the
///    [Air::PublicInputs] associated type.
/// 3. Implement [Air::new()] function. As a part of this function you should create a
///    [AirContext] struct which takes degrees for all transition constraints as one of
///    the constructor parameters.
/// 4. Implement [Air::context()] method which should return a reference to the
///    [AirContext] struct created in [Air::new()] function.
/// 5. Implement [Air::evaluate_transition()] method which should evaluate
///    [transition constraints](#transition-constraints) over a given evaluation frame.
/// 6. Implement [Air::get_assertions()] method which should return a vector of
///    [assertions](#trace-assertions) for a given instance of your computation.
/// 7. If your computation requires [periodic values](#periodic-values), you can also override
///    the default [Air::get_periodic_column_values()] method.
///
/// ### Transition constraints
/// Transition constraints define algebraic relations between two consecutive steps of a
/// computation. In Winterfell, transition constraints are evaluated inside
/// [Air::evaluate_transition()] function which takes the following parameters:
///
/// - [EvaluationFrame] which contains vectors with current and next states of the
///   computation.
/// - A list of periodic values. When periodic columns are defined for a computation,
///   this will contain values of periodic columns at the current step of the computation.
///   Otherwise, this will be an empty list.
/// - A mutable `result` slice. This is the slice where constraint evaluations should be
///   written to. The length of this slice will be equal to the number of transition
///   constraints defined for the computation.
///
/// The constraints are considered to be satisfied if and only if, after the function returns,
/// the `result` slice contains all zeros. In general, it is important for the transition
/// constraint evaluation function to work as follows:
///
/// * For all valid transitions between consecutive computation steps, transition constraints
///   should evaluation to all zeros.
/// * For any invalid transition, at least one constraint must evaluate to a non-zero value.
///
/// **Note:** since transition constraints define algebraic relations, they should be
/// described using only algebraic operations: additions, subtractions, and multiplications
/// (divisions can be emulated using inverse of multiplication).
///
/// ### Constraint degrees
/// One of the main factors impacting proof generation time and proof size is the maximum degree
/// of transition constraints. The higher is this degree, the larger our blowup factor needs to be.
/// Usually, we want to keep this degree as low as possible - e.g. under 4 or 8. To accurately
/// describe degrees of your transition constraints, keep the following in mind:
///
/// * All trace registers have degree `1`.
/// * When multiplying trace registers together, the degree increases by `1`. For example, if our
///   constraint involves multiplication of two registers, the degree of this constraint will be
///   `2`. We can describe this constraint using [TransitionConstraintDegree] struct as follows:
///   `TransitionConstraintDegree::new(2)`.
/// * Degrees of periodic columns depend on the length of their cycles, but in most cases, these
///   degrees are very close to `1`.
/// * To describe a degree of a constraint involving multiplication of trace registers and
///   periodic columns, use the [TransitionConstraintDegree::with_cycles()] constructor. For
///   example, if our constraint involves multiplication of one trace register and one periodic
///   column with a cycle of 32 steps, the degree can be described as:
///   `TransitionConstraintDegree::with_cycles(1, vec![32])`.
///
/// In general, multiplications should be used judiciously - though, there are ways to ease this
/// restriction a bit at the expense of wider execution trace.
///
/// ### Trace assertions
/// Assertions are used to specify that a valid execution trace of a computation must contain
/// certain values in certain cells. They are frequently used to tie public inputs to a specific
/// execution trace, but can be used to constrain a computation in other ways as well.
/// Internally within Winterfell, assertions are converted into *boundary constraints*.
///
/// To define assertions for your computation, you'll need to implement [Air::get_assertions()]
/// function which should return a vector of [Assertion] structs. Every computation must have at
/// least one assertion. Assertions can be of the following types:
///
/// * A single assertion - such assertion specifies that a single cell of an execution trace must
///   be equal to a specific value. For example: *value in register 0, at step 0, must be equal
///   to 1*.
/// * A periodic assertion - such assertion specifies that values in a given register at specified
///   intervals should be equal to some value. For example: *values in register 0, at steps 0, 8,
///   16, 24 etc. must be equal to 2*.
/// * A sequence assertion - such assertion specifies that values in a given register at specific
///   intervals must be equal to a sequence of provided values. For example: *values in register 0,
///   at step 0 must be equal to 1, at step 8 must be equal to 2, at step 16 must be equal to 3
///   etc.*
///
/// ### Periodic values
/// Sometimes, it may be useful to define a column in an execution trace which contains a set of
/// repeating values. For example, let's say we have a register which contains value 1 on every
/// 4th step, and 0 otherwise. Such a column can be described with a simple periodic sequence of
/// `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.
///
/// To define such columns for your computation, you can override
/// [Air::get_periodic_column_values()] method. The values of the periodic columns at a given
/// step of the computation will be supplied to the [Air::evaluate_transition()] method via the
/// `periodic_values` parameter.
