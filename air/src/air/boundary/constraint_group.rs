// BOUNDARY CONSTRAINT GROUP
// ================================================================================================
/// A group of boundary constraints all having the same divisor.
///
/// A boundary constraint is described by a rational function $\frac{f(x) - b(x)}{z(x)}$, where:
///
/// * $f(x)$ is a trace polynomial for the column against which the constraint is placed.
/// * $b(x)$ is the value polynomial for the constraint.
/// * $z(x)$ is the constraint divisor polynomial.
///
/// A boundary constraint group groups together all boundary constraints where polynomial $z$ is
/// the same. The constraints stored in the group describe polynomials $b$. At the time of
/// constraint evaluation, a prover or a verifier provides evaluations of the relevant polynomial
/// $f$ so that the value of the constraint can be computed.
///
/// When the protocol is run in a large field, types `F` and `E` are the same. However, when
/// working with small fields, `F` and `E` can be set as follows:
/// * `F` could be the base field of the protocol, in which case `E` is the extension field used.
/// * `F` could be the extension field, in which case `F` and `E` are the same type.
///
/// The above arrangement allows us to describe boundary constraints for main and auxiliary
/// segments of the execution trace. Specifically:
/// * For the constraints against columns of the main execution trace, `F` is set to the base field
///   of the protocol, and `E` is set to the extension field.
/// * For the constraints against columns of auxiliary trace segments, both `F` and `E` are set to
///   the extension field.
