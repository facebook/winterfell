// BOUNDARY CONSTRAINT INFO
// ================================================================================================

/// Boundary constraints for a computation.
///
/// Boundary constraints are arranged into two categories: constraints against columns of the main
/// trace segment, and constraints against columns of auxiliary trace segments. Within each
/// category, the constraints are grouped by their divisor (see [BoundaryConstraintGroup] for
/// more info on boundary constraint structure).
///
/// When the protocol is run in a large field, types `B` and `E` are the same. However, when
/// working with small fields, these types are used as follows:
/// * Constraints against columns of the main segment of the execution trace are defined over the
///   field specified by `B`.
/// * Constraints against columns of auxiliary segments of the execution trace (if any) are defined
///   over the field specified by `E`.
/// * Constraint composition coefficients are defined over the field specified by `E`.
/// * Constraint divisors are defined over the field specified by `B`.
