// BOUNDARY CONSTRAINT
// ================================================================================================
/// The numerator portion of a boundary constraint.
///
/// A boundary constraint is described by a rational function $\frac{f(x) - b(x)}{z(x)}$, where:
///
/// * $f(x)$ is a trace polynomial for the column against which the constraint is placed.
/// * $b(b)$ is the value polynomial for this constraint.
/// * $z(x)$ is the constraint divisor polynomial.
///
/// In addition to the value polynomial, a [BoundaryConstraint] also contains info needed to
/// evaluate the constraint and to compose constraint evaluations with other constraints (i.e.,
/// constraint composition coefficient).
///
/// When the protocol is run in a large field, types `F` and `E` are the same. However, when
/// working with small fields, `F` and `E` can be set as follows:
/// * `F` could be the base field of the protocol, in which case `E` is the extension field used.
/// * `F` could be the extension field, in which case `F` and `E` are the same type.
///
/// Boundary constraints cannot be instantiated directly, they are created internally from
/// [Assertions](Assertion).
