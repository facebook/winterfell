// TRANSITION CONSTRAINT DEGREE

/// columns. For example, degree of a constraint which requires multiplication of two trace
/// columns can be described as: `base: 2, cycles: []`. A constraint which requires
/// multiplication of 3 trace columns and a periodic column with a period of 32 steps can be
/// described as: `base: 3, cycles: [32]`.
