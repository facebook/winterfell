//! FFT-based polynomial evaluation and interpolation.
//!
//! Functions in this module can be used to evaluate and interpolate polynomials over domains
//! which are multiplicative subgroups of finite fields and have lengths equal to powers of two.
//! As compared to evaluation and interpolation functions available in the `polynom` module,
//! these functions are much more efficient: their runtime complexity is O(`n` log `n`), where
//! `n` is the domain size.
