// TRACE TABLE
// ================================================================================================
/// A concrete implementation of the [Trace] trait.
///
/// This implementation supports concurrent trace generation and should be sufficient for most use
/// cases. There are two ways to create a trace table trace.
///
/// First, you can use the [TraceTable::init()] function which takes a set of vectors as a
/// parameter, where each vector contains values for a given column of the trace. This approach
/// allows you to build an execution trace as you see fit, as long as it meets a basic set of
/// requirements. These requirements are:
///
/// 1. Lengths of all columns in the execution trace must be the same.
/// 2. The length of the columns must be some power of two.
///
/// The other approach is to use [TraceTable::new()] function, which takes trace width and
/// length as parameters. This function will allocate memory for the trace, but will not fill it
/// with data. To fill the execution trace, you can use the [fill()](TraceTable::fill) method,
/// which takes two closures as parameters:
///
/// 1. The first closure is responsible for initializing the first state of the computation
///    (the first row of the execution trace).
/// 2. The second closure receives the previous state of the execution trace as input, and must
///    update it to the next state of the computation.
///
/// You can also use [TraceTable::with_meta()] function to create a blank execution trace.
/// This function work just like [TraceTable::new()] function, but also takes a metadata
/// parameter which can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes up to 64KB in size.
///
/// # Concurrent trace generation
/// For computations which consist of many small independent computations, we can generate the
/// execution trace of the entire computation by building fragments of the trace in parallel,
/// and then joining these fragments together.
///
/// For this purpose, `TraceTable` struct exposes [fragments()](TraceTable::fragments)
/// method, which takes fragment length as a parameter, breaks the execution trace into equally
/// sized fragments, and returns an iterator over these fragments. You can then use fragment's
/// [fill()](TraceTableFragment::fill) method to fill all fragments with data in parallel.
/// The semantics of the fragment's [TraceTableFragment::fill()] method are identical to the
/// semantics of the [TraceTable::fill()] method.
