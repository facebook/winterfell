//! This crate contains Winterfell STARK prover and verifier.
//!
//! A STARK is a novel proof-of-computation scheme to create efficiently verifiable proofs of the
//! correct execution of a computation. The scheme was developed by Eli Ben-Sasson, Michael Riabzev
//! et al. at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. STARKs do not require an initial trusted
//! setup, and rely on very few cryptographic assumptions. See [references](#references) for more
//! info.
//!
//! ## Proof generation
//! To generate a proof that a computation was executed correctly, you'll need to do the
//! following:
//!
//! 1. Define an *algebraic intermediate representation* (AIR) for your computation. This can
//!    be done by implementing [Air] trait.
//! 2. Define an execution trace for your computation. This can be done by implementing [Trace]
//!    trait. Alternatively, you can use [TraceTable] struct which already implements [Trace]
//!    trait in cases when this generic implementation works for your use case.
//! 3. Execute your computation and record its execution trace.
//! 4. Define your prover by implementing [Prover] trait. Then execute [Prover::prove()] function
//!    passing the trace generated in the previous step into it as a parameter. The function will
//!    return a instance of [StarkProof].
//!
//! This `StarkProof` can be serialized and sent to a STARK verifier for verification. The size
//! of proof depends on the specifics of a given computation, but for most computations it should
//! be in the range between 15 KB (for very small computations) and 300 KB (for very large
//! computations).
//!
//! Proof generation time is also highly dependent on the specifics of a given computation, but
//! also depends on the capabilities of the machine used to generate the proofs (i.e. on number
//! of CPU cores and memory bandwidth).
//!
//! When the crate is compiled with `concurrent` feature enabled, proof generation will be
//! performed in multiple threads (usually, as many threads as there are logical cores on the
//! machine). The number of threads can be configured via `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment
//! variable.
//!
//! ## Prof verification
//! To verify a [StarkProof] generated as described in the previous sections, you'll need to
//! do the following:
//!
//! 1. Define an *algebraic intermediate representation* (AIR) for you computation. This AIR
//!    must be the same as the one used during proof generation process.
//! 2. Execute [verify()] function and supply the AIR of your computation together with the
//!    [StarkProof] and related public inputs as parameters.
//!
//! Proof verification is extremely fast and is nearly independent of the complexity of the
//! computation being verified. In vast majority of cases proofs can be verified in 3 - 5 ms
//! on a modern mid-range laptop CPU (using a single core).
//!
//! There is one exception, however: if a computation requires a lot of `sequence` assertions
//! (see [Assertion] for more info), the verification time will grow linearly in the number of
//! asserted values. But for the impact to be noticeable, the number of asserted values would
//! need to be in tens of thousands. And even for hundreds of thousands of asserted values, the
//! verification time should not exceed 50 ms.
//!
//! # Examples
//! The best way to understand the STARK proof generation and verification process is to go
//! through a trivial example from start to finish. First, we'll need to pick a computation for
//! which we'll be generating and verifying STARK proofs. To keep things simple, we'll use the
//! following:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winterfell::math::{fields::f128::BaseElement, FieldElement};
//!
//! fn do_work(start: BaseElement, n: usize) -> BaseElement {
//!    let mut result = start;
//!    for _ in 1..n {
//!        result = result.exp(3) + BaseElement::new(42);
//!    }
//!    result
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This computation starts with an element in a finite field and then, for the specified number
//! of steps, cubes the element and adds value `42` to it.
//!
//! Suppose, we run this computation for a million steps and get some result. Using STARKs we can
//! prove that we did the work correctly without requiring any verifying party to re-execute the
//! computation. Here is how to do it:
//!
//! First, we need to define an *execution trace* for our computation. This trace should capture
//! the state of the computation at every step of its execution. In our case, the trace is just a
//! single column of intermediate values after each execution of the loop. For example, if we start
//! with value `3` and run the computation for 1,048,576 (same as 2<sup>20</sup>) steps, the
//! execution trace will look like this:
//!
//! | Step      | State  |
//! | :-------: | :----- |
//! | 0         | 3      |
//! | 1         | 69     |
//! | 2         | 328551 |
//! | 3         | 35465687262668193 |
//! | 4         | 237280320818395402166933071684267763523 |
//! | ...       |
//! | 1,048,575 | 247770943907079986105389697876176586605 |
//!
//! To record the trace, we'll use the [TraceTable] struct. The function below, is just a
//! modified version of the `do_work()` function which records every intermediate state of the
//! computation in the [TraceTable] struct:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winterfell::{
//!     math::{fields::f128::BaseElement, FieldElement},
//!     TraceTable,
//! };
//!
//! pub fn build_do_work_trace(start: BaseElement, n: usize) -> TraceTable<BaseElement> {
//!     // Instantiate the trace with a given width and length; this will allocate all
//!     // required memory for the trace
//!     let trace_width = 1;
//!     let mut trace = TraceTable::new(trace_width, n);
//!
//!     // Fill the trace with data; the first closure initializes the first state of the
//!     // computation; the second closure computes the next state of the computation based
//!     // on its current state.
//!     trace.fill(
//!         |state| {
//!             state[0] = start;
//!         },
//!         |_, state| {
//!             state[0] = state[0].exp(3u32.into()) + BaseElement::new(42);
//!         },
//!     );
//!
//!     trace
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Next, we need to define *algebraic intermediate representation* (AIR) for our computation.
//! This process is usually called *arithmetization*. We do this by implementing the [Air] trait.
//! At the high level, the code below does three things:
//!
//! 1. Defines what the public inputs for our computation should look like. These inputs are
//!    called "public" because they must be known to both, the prover and the verifier.
//! 2. Defines a transition function with a single transition constraint. This transition
//!    constraint must evaluate to zero for all valid state transitions, and to non-zero for any
//!    invalid state transition. The degree of this constraint is 3 (see more about constraint
//!    degrees "Constraint degrees" section of [Air] trait documentation).
//! 3. Define two assertions against an execution trace of our computation. These assertions tie
//!    a specific set of public inputs to a specific execution trace (see more about assertions
//!    "Trace assertions" section of [Air] trait documentation).
//!
//! Here is the actual code:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winterfell::{
//!     math::{fields::f128::BaseElement, FieldElement, ToElements},
//!     Air, AirContext, Assertion, ByteWriter, EvaluationFrame, ProofOptions, TraceInfo,
//!     TransitionConstraintDegree, crypto::{hashers::Blake3_256, DefaultRandomCoin},
//! };
//!
//! // Public inputs for our computation will consist of the starting value and the end result.
//! pub struct PublicInputs {
//!     start: BaseElement,
//!     result: BaseElement,
//! }
//!
//! // We need to describe how public inputs can be converted to field elements.
//! impl ToElements<BaseElement> for PublicInputs {
//!     fn to_elements(&self) -> Vec<BaseElement> {
//!         vec![self.start, self.result]
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // For a specific instance of our computation, we'll keep track of the public inputs and
//! // the computation's context which we'll build in the constructor. The context is used
//! // internally by the Winterfell prover/verifier when interpreting this AIR.
//! pub struct WorkAir {
//!     context: AirContext<BaseElement>,
//!     start: BaseElement,
//!     result: BaseElement,
//! }
//!
//! impl Air for WorkAir {
//!     // First, we'll specify which finite field to use for our computation, and also how
//!     // the public inputs must look like.
//!     type BaseField = BaseElement;
//!     type PublicInputs = PublicInputs;
//!
//!     // Here, we'll construct a new instance of our computation which is defined by 3
//!     // parameters: starting value, number of steps, and the end result. Another way to
//!     // think about it is that an instance of our computation is a specific invocation of
//!     // the do_work() function.
//!     fn new(trace_info: TraceInfo, pub_inputs: PublicInputs, options: ProofOptions) -> Self {
//!         // our execution trace should have only one column.
//!         assert_eq!(1, trace_info.width());
//!
//!         // Our computation requires a single transition constraint. The constraint itself
//!         // is defined in the evaluate_transition() method below, but here we need to specify
//!         // the expected degree of the constraint. If the expected and actual degrees of the
//!         // constraints don't match, an error will be thrown in the debug mode, but in release
//!         // mode, an invalid proof will be generated which will not be accepted by any verifier.
//!         let degrees = vec![TransitionConstraintDegree::new(3)];
//!
//!         // We also need to specify the exact number of assertions we will place against the
//!         // execution trace. This number must be the same as the number of items in a vector
//!         // returned from the get_assertions() method below.
//!         let num_assertions = 2;
//!
//!         WorkAir {
//!             context: AirContext::new(trace_info, degrees, num_assertions, options),
//!             start: pub_inputs.start,
//!             result: pub_inputs.result,
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // In this method we'll define our transition constraints; a computation is considered to
//!     // be valid, if for all valid state transitions, transition constraints evaluate to all
//!     // zeros, and for any invalid transition, at least one constraint evaluates to a non-zero
//!     // value. The `frame` parameter will contain current and next states of the computation.
//!     fn evaluate_transition<E: FieldElement + From<Self::BaseField>>(
//!         &self,
//!         frame: &EvaluationFrame<E>,
//!         _periodic_values: &[E],
//!         result: &mut [E],
//!     ) {
//!         // First, we'll read the current state, and use it to compute the expected next state
//!         let current_state = &frame.current()[0];
//!         let next_state = current_state.exp(3u32.into()) + E::from(42u32);
//!
//!         // Then, we'll subtract the expected next state from the actual next state; this will
//!         // evaluate to zero if and only if the expected and actual states are the same.
//!         result[0] = frame.next()[0] - next_state;
//!     }
//!
//!     // Here, we'll define a set of assertions about the execution trace which must be
//!     // satisfied for the computation to be valid. Essentially, this ties computation's
//!     // execution trace to the public inputs.
//!     fn get_assertions(&self) -> Vec<Assertion<Self::BaseField>> {
//!         // for our computation to be valid, value in column 0 at step 0 must be equal to the
//!         // starting value, and at the last step it must be equal to the result.
//!         let last_step = self.trace_length() - 1;
//!         vec![
//!             Assertion::single(0, 0, self.start),
//!             Assertion::single(0, last_step, self.result),
//!         ]
//!     }
//!
//!     // This is just boilerplate which is used by the Winterfell prover/verifier to retrieve
//!     // the context of the computation.
//!     fn context(&self) -> &AirContext<Self::BaseField> {
//!         &self.context
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Next, we need define our prover. This can be done by implementing [Prover] trait. The trait is
//! pretty simple and has just a few required methods. Here is how our implementation could look
//! like:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use winterfell::{
//!     math::{fields::f128::BaseElement, FieldElement, ToElements},
//!     ProofOptions, Prover, Trace, TraceTable, crypto::{hashers::Blake3_256, DefaultRandomCoin}
//! };
//!

//! #
//! # impl ToElements<BaseElement> for PublicInputs {
//! #     fn to_elements(&self) -> Vec<BaseElement> {
//! #         vec![self.start, self.result]
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! # pub struct WorkAir {
//! #     context: AirContext<BaseElement>,
//! #     start: BaseElement,
//! #     result: BaseElement,
//! # }
//! #
//! # impl Air for WorkAir {

//! #     type PublicInputs = PublicInputs;
//! #
//! #     fn new(trace_info: TraceInfo, pub_inputs: PublicInputs, options: ProofOptions) -> Self {
//! #         assert_eq!(1, trace_info.width());
//! #         let degrees = vec![TransitionConstraintDegree::new(3)];
//! #         WorkAir {
//! #             context: AirContext::new(trace_info, degrees, 2, options),
//! #             start: pub_inputs.start,
//! #             result: pub_inputs.result,
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #
//! #     fn evaluate_transition<E: FieldElement + From<Self::BaseField>>(
//! #         &self,
//! #         frame: &EvaluationFrame<E>,
//! #         _periodic_values: &[E],
//! #         result: &mut [E],
//! #     ) {
//! #         let current_state = &frame.current()[0];
//! #         let next_state = current_state.exp(3u32.into()) + E::from(42u32);
//! #         result[0] = frame.next()[0] - next_state;
//! #     }
//! #
//! #     fn get_assertions(&self) -> Vec<Assertion<Self::BaseField>> {
//! #         let last_step = self.trace_length() - 1;
//! #         vec![
//! #             Assertion::single(0, 0, self.start),
//! #             Assertion::single(0, last_step, self.result),
//! #         ]
//! #     }
//! #
//! #     fn context(&self) -> &AirContext<Self::BaseField> {
//! #         &self.context
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! // Our prover needs to hold STARK protocol parameters which are specified via ProofOptions
//! // struct.
//! struct WorkProver {

//! }
//!
//! impl WorkProver {
//!     pub fn new(options: ProofOptions) -> Self {
//!         Self { options }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // When implementing Prover trait we set the `Air` associated type to the AIR of the
//! // computation we defined previously, and set the `Trace` associated type to `TraceTable`
//! // struct as we don't need to define a custom trace for our computation.
//! impl Prover for WorkProver {
//!     type BaseField = BaseElement;
//!     type Air = WorkAir;
//!     type Trace = TraceTable<Self::BaseField>;
//!     type HashFn = Blake3_256<Self::BaseField>;
//!     type RandomCoin = DefaultRandomCoin<Self::HashFn>;
//!
//!     // Our public inputs consist of the first and last value in the execution trace.
//!     fn get_pub_inputs(&self, trace: &Self::Trace) -> PublicInputs {
//!         let last_step = trace.length() - 1;
//!         PublicInputs {

//! ```
//!
//! Now, we are finally ready to generate and verify STARK proofs.
//!
//! In the code below, we will execute our computation and get the result together with the proof
//! that the computation was executed correctly. Then, we will use this proof (together with the
//! public inputs) to verify that we did in fact execute the computation and got the claimed
//! result.
